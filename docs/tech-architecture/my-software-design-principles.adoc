= My Software Design Principles

An amalgamation of my own software design principles over time.
This is a living document that is subject to change.

* _Explicit over implicit_: the clearer code is, and the more transparent, the easier it is to understand, debug, and maintain.
* _Compile-time checks over runtime checks_: the earlier errors can be found and requirements are enforced, the less time will be wasted. 
* _Automated gates and controls over manual ones or documentation_: controls that are automated will always be more reliably enforced and abided by than manual ones or documented specs and requirements.
* _Tests are an absolute must, committed with changes, not after_: the benefits of testing are well known and understood, so there is no excuse for putting it off and having under-tested code.
Use good testing libraries to achieve what you need, test thoroughly and integration test, keep coverage high.
