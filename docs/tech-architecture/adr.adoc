= Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document in a particular format, which captures an architecturally meaningful decision. 
The purpose of such documentation is to be able to share with new-joiners or others why a decision was made, the context at the time, and the general thinking process around it - in addition to the decision itself!
