= My Design Principles

An amalgamation of my own principles as thought of over time.

* Explicit over implicit: the clearer code is, and the more transparent, the easier it is to understand, debug, and maintain.
* Compile-time checks over runtime checks: the earlier errors can be found and requirements are enforced, the less time will be wasted. 
* Automated gates and controls over manual ones and documentation: controls that are automated will always be more reliable enforced and abided by than manual ones or documented specs and requirements.
