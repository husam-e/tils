The only way to go fast, is to go well.

[quote, Uncle Bob talk on clean code]
Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.


- First rule of functions: they should be small. 
Second rule: they should be smaller than that. 
They should **do one thing**.
- Functions should not oscillate between levels of abstraction the way our brain does when we think about and write code.
- Extract into methods until you cannot extract anymore, so the code looks like well-written prose.
- Every line of code in a function should always be at the same level of abstraction, which is 1 level below the function name.

[quote, Clean Code book title page]
Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. 
There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.
