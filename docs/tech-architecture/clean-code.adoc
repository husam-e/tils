Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.


* First rule of functions: they should be small. 
Second rule: they should be smaller than that. 
Hardly more than 20 lines, and do one thing.
* Functions should not oscillate between levels of abstraction the way our brain does when we think about and write code.
* Every line of code in a function should always be at the same level of abstraction, which is 1 level below the function name.
