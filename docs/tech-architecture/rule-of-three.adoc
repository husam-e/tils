= Rule of three

Code refactoring rule of thumb: "two instances of similar code don't require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure."

The premise is that having additional example patterns is often useful for abstracting a design or coming up with a generic solution.
KISS > DRY otherwise.

Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
