= The Competency Trap

[quote, linked Medium article below]
A competency trap is that false belief that your past principles, ideas, mental models will continually lead to future successes and better judgement.

[quote, linked Medium article below]
You can be so good at what you do that you can be blinded by your past successes. 
Doing something well can often get you stuck in a loop. Instead of growing and evolving, the competency trap can stand in the way of your incremental progress.

[quote, linked Medium article below]
In a constantly changing and ambiguous world, previous successes can stand in the way of new opportunities. 
To thrive in the future, revisit your past performances, adopt a flexible mindset and disrupt yourself â€” compete with yourself. 
Your goal should be to make yourself redundant.
