= Curse of knowledge

[quote, Wikipedia]
The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.

[quote, Wikipedia]
For example, in a classroom setting, teachers have difficulty teaching novices because they cannot put themselves in the position of the student. 
A brilliant professor might no longer remember the difficulties that a young student encounters when learning a new subject.
