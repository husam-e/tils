= Beginner's mind

[quote, Wikipedia]
Shoshin (初心) is a word from Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's mind." 
It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would.

It allows people to be open-minded with a growth mindset, as opposed to stubbornly getting fixated into pre-existing views.
