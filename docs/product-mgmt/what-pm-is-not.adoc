= What Product Managers are *not*

== 1. Project managers

Build and manage towards outcomes instead of pre-specified features.
Deal with uncertainty as opposed to planning around specs.

== 2. JIRA jockeys

Responsible for helping the team prioritize work, regardless of the tool used.
Not responsible for driving the velocity of delivery.

== 3. Actual managers

Need not manage people.
Not the CEOs of the product. 
Lead not with authority but with influence, data, evidence and compelling storytelling.

== 4. Fortune tellers

Can't predict the future but can make educated guesses.
We should instead expect hypotheses driven by market and customer research.
