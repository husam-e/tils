= Spring Mobile

A framework for detecting the type of device requests are coming from, to leverage in a Spring application.
Provides APIs specifically for determining if the client is mobile, a tablet, or regular browser.

Can come in handy for personalization/customization depending on the device, and potentially for analytics as well.
