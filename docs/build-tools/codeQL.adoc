= CodeQL

Security vulnerability code scanner that provides detailed info and analysis, including looking through data and code flows to identify issues.
It also provides explanations of fix recommendations, and can be setup to run as a github action.

It effectively creates its own database of a repository, allowing you to run queries in the language across it.

Available online at https://LGTM.com for OSI approved projects, and also available for VS Code.
